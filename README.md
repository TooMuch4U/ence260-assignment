# Pong
A two player pong game for the UC Fun Kit V4. Created by Emma Hogan and Tom Rizzi.
## Loading the Game
The game can be loaded onto a fun kit using the makefile provided.
```bash
make program
```
## How to Play
When the game is loaded onto the UCFK4, scrolling pong text will be displayed. Push the navigation switch on both fun kits to setup the game. A paddle will be shown on each screen that can be moved left and right by pressing the nav switch in the respective direction. The game can be started by pressing the nav switch, launching the ball at the opponent.

The first player to 5 points wins. To score a point, you need to get the ball to hit the opponents backboard (missing the paddle). The direction of the ball can be changed by hitting it with the left, right or middle of the paddle, sending the ball in the respective direction.
